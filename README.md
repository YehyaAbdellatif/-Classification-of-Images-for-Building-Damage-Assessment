# Classification-of-Images-for-Building-Damage-Assessment
This project is centered around using deep learning technologies for a civil engineering application, namely recognition of structural damage from images. Damage surveys currently require teams of domain experts to visually inspect buildings to determine their safety, which is slow and subjective. Our objective is to automate the process using computer vision, in this project we use a supervised learning approach over 8 different recognition tasks: scene level, damage state, spalling condition, material type, collapse mode, component type, damage level, and damage type. The model will be constructed from 8 different CNN models and each image will be passed through the 8 recognition tasks to see which class in each recognition task it applies to. The challenge will be running all 8 recognition tasks to their fullest and handling the individual errors that might show up in each model along with the load on the PC to run these models consecutively.
This project aims to replace the current process, simplify the process and add consistency to the work done on analyzing structural damage and through the accuracy achieved in this project of over 80% accuracy on each recognition task we believe it is possible for this type of model to start taking over this type of work on a larger level, especially in cases of natural disasters where we need a quick and accurate analysis of the structural damage at a time where resources are spread thin, this type of project creates an unlimited resource to pull from in those situations.
