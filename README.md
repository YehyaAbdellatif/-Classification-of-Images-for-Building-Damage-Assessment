# Classification-of-Images-for-Building-Damage-Assessment
This project is centered around using deep learning technologies for a civil engineering application, namely recognition of structural damage from images. Damage surveys currently require teams of domain experts to visually inspect buildings to determine their safety, which is slow and subjective. Our objective is to automate the process using computer vision, in this project we use a supervised learning approach over 8 different recognition tasks: scene level, damage state, spalling condition, material type, collapse mode, component type, damage level, and damage type. The model will be constructed from 8 different CNN models and each image will be passed through the 8 recognition tasks to see which class in each recognition task it applies to. The challenge will be running all 8 recognition tasks to their fullest and handling the individual errors that might show up in each model along with the load on the PC to run these models consecutively.
This project aims to replace the current process, simplify the process and add consistency to the work done on analyzing structural damage and through the accuracy achieved in this project of over 80% accuracy on each recognition task we believe it is possible for this type of model to start taking over this type of work on a larger level, especially in cases of natural disasters where we need a quick and accurate analysis of the structural damage at a time where resources are spread thin, this type of project creates an unlimited resource to pull from in those situations.

#Introduction:
Ensuring the proper performance of all elements in a structure is a priority for designers and users. In most cases, continuous monitoring can detect damages at an early stage can prevent potential accidents and catastrophes that result from inadequate inspection or damages to the evaluation process. Structural health monitoring (SHM) involves the use of continuous monitoring using sensors that are permanently attached to the structure, together with algorithms related to the damage-identification process.
Collapses of civil infrastructures strike public opinion more and more often. They are generally due to either structural deterioration or modified working conditions with respect to the design ones. The main challenge of structural health monitoring is to increase the safety level of ageing structures by detecting, locating and quantifying the presence and the development of damages, possibly in real-time
However, visual inspections—whose frequencies are usually determined by the importance and the age of the structure—are still the workhorse in this field, even if they are rarely able to provide a quantitative estimate of structural damages. Therefore, it is evident why recent advances in sensing technologies and signal processing, coupled to the increased availability of computing power, are creating huge expectations in the development of robust and continuous SHM systems.
Structural health monitoring (SHM) and rapid damage assessment after natural hazards and disasters have become an important focus in civil engineering. Moreover, structural response records and images as the data media play an increasing role in nowadays data explosion epoch. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are developing rapidly, especially in applications of deep learning (DL) in computer vision, which made giant progress in recent years. 
In addition, the objective of implementation of ML and DL is to make computers perform labor-intensive repetitive tasks and also learn from past experiences. Nowadays, structural damage recognition using images is one of the important topics in vision-based SHM and structural reconnaissance, which greatly relies on human visual inspection and experience. However, several recent non-DL studies are addressing issues related to relatively tedious manual efforts.
Thus, following this trend, it is timely to implement the state-of-art DL technologies in civil engineering applications and evaluate its potential benefits.
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains the computer to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they see. In deep learning a convolutional neural network is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery, CNN has been at the heart of spectacular recent advances in deep learning and is better than traditional computer vision and machine learning approaches due to many reasons including its depth of architecture and it no longer needing low level features or feature engineering, so CNNs use relatively little preprocessing compared to other image classification algorithms.
With such strong advances in image classification we have the chance to use it for structural health monitoring, so far only a few researches or applications of CNN exist in post disaster reconnaissance or SHM, civil engineering applications have not fully benefited from the data driven computer science or computer vision technologies, and so our aim is to combine the two fields and have a program that civil engineering can benefit from greatly.
The field of civil engineering needs more studies geared towards machine learning to get the full benefit from that field and this project is a step in that direction.
In general, our objectives for this project are as follows: 
1.	Gather labelled and unlabeled data for structural health monitoring and post disaster reconnaissance for the purpose of applying machine learning algorithms
2.	Create 8 different recognition tasks covering thousands of images each to be classified into multiple classes for each recognition task
3.	Make an effective, consistent, and time efficient program capable of classifying structural damage on multiple levels and ready for regular use in structural health monitoring
